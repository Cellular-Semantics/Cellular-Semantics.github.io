# How to edit and deploy

## Editing content

Authoring content: https://getdoks.org/docs/basics/authoring-content/

- Home Page: Edit `content/_index.md` to see this page change. See `layouts/index.html` for design
- Add Markdown files to `content` folder to create new pages.
- Top menus: Edit `config/_default/menus/menus.en.toml`
- Projects content: Doks will automatically generate a sidebar based on the filesystem structure of your documentation in `content` folder, using each fileâ€™s title property as the sidebar entry. For details see [Navigation documentation](https://getdoks.org/docs/basics/navigation/)
