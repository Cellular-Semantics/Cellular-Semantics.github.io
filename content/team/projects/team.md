Part of the Wellcome Sanger Institute’s Cellular Genetics Department, the  **Cellular Semantics Team** is dedicated to advancing knowledge in cell classification and understanding cellular diversity. We specialize in developing and curating the **Cell Ontology**—a dynamic, structured vocabulary of cell types essential for accurate data integration and analysis in the life sciences.

Our team combines expertise in cell biology, bioinformatics, and ontology development to create precise and up-to-date definitions that support the growing fields of single-cell genomics, transcriptomics, neuroscience, and beyond. By collaborating with scientific experts worldwide, we ensure that the Cell Ontology remains a reliable resource for researchers looking to classify and analyze cellular data at scale. We are also major contributors to a suite of interconnected Open Biomedical Ontologies including the Uberon anatomy ontology.

Explore our work, meet the [team](/team/members/team-members), and learn how we’re making strides in cellular classification, supporting discoveries that bridge molecular data with biological meaning.

Team's projects are:
